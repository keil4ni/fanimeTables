# ABOUT fanimeTables:
this is a mini program i made for fun becos i listed all the tables i wanted to visit at fanime and they were not in order. so i made them be in order. ðŸ˜± 
i also just wanted to practice some python since i'm taking a class for it rn. this program is helpful for me becos there'll be many artists at artist alley and i probably spent like the last 3-ish hours of my day looking through all of them.

# I Will Visit All of Them.
# not only will i be happy. but my wallet will be EMPTY
